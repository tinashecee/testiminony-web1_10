# M4A Audio Format Support Implementation

## Overview
Added support for M4A audio format in the manual recording upload functionality of the testimony web application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated File Input Accept Attribute
**File**: `components/recording/AddRecordingModal.tsx`

**Before**:
```html
accept=".wav,.mp3,audio/wav,audio/mpeg"
```

**After**:
```html
accept=".wav,.mp3,.m4a,audio/wav,audio/mpeg,audio/mp4,audio/x-m4a,audio/aac,audio/x-aac,audio/m4a"
```

### 2. Enhanced File Validation
Added comprehensive client-side validation for M4A files:

- **File Type Validation**: Checks both MIME types and file extensions
- **Supported MIME Types**: 
  - `audio/wav`
  - `audio/mpeg` 
  - `audio/mp3`
  - `audio/mp4`
  - `audio/x-m4a`
  - `audio/aac`
  - `audio/x-aac`
  - `audio/m4a`

- **Supported Extensions**: `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`

### 3. File Size Validation
Added 100MB file size limit with user-friendly error messages.

### 4. Updated User Interface
- Updated help text to show "Supported formats: WAV, MP3, M4A"
- Added proper error handling for invalid file types

### 5. Audit Logging Integration
Added audit logging for recording uploads to track:
- File format used (WAV, MP3, or M4A)
- Recording details (title, case number)
- Upload timestamp and user information

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
M4A files are supported by:
- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support  
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support

### Backend Considerations
The frontend changes are sufficient for M4A support, but ensure your backend:
1. Accepts M4A files in the upload endpoint
2. Properly handles M4A file processing
3. Stores M4A files correctly
4. Serves M4A files with proper MIME type headers

### Audio Player Compatibility
The existing AudioPlayer component uses HTML5 `<audio>` element which natively supports M4A files, so no additional changes are needed for playback.

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Valid M4A Upload**: Upload a valid M4A file and verify it's accepted
2. **Invalid File Type**: Try uploading non-audio files and verify rejection
3. **Large File**: Try uploading files >100MB and verify size limit enforcement
4. **Playback**: Verify uploaded M4A files play correctly in the audio player
5. **Audit Logging**: Check that M4A uploads are properly logged in the audit trail

### Test Files
Use these file types for testing:
- `.m4a` - Standard M4A audio files
- `.mp4` - MP4 files with audio (may have M4A audio track)
- `.aac` - AAC audio files (related to M4A)

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Compatibility**: Users can now upload recordings in M4A format
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages for unsupported formats
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of upload activities including file formats
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more audio formats in the future

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding support for:
- **FLAC**: Lossless audio format
- **OGG**: Open source audio format
- **AAC**: Advanced Audio Coding
- **WMA**: Windows Media Audio (if needed)

## Notes

- M4A files are typically smaller than WAV files while maintaining good quality
- M4A is widely supported across different devices and platforms
- The implementation includes fallback validation for browsers that don't report MIME types correctly
